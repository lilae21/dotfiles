# A keyboard layout for Dundulanyä
## (+ Italian, and suitable for some of my other conlangs)

I have been using for years a specific keyboard layout for typing in my conlangs more rapidly, given that Chlouvānem and then Dundulanyä use lots of diacritics. I started using custom keyboard layouts under Mac OS around 2013; then, when I switched to Linux in 2020, I learned again how to create them (a huge thank you to [*Karel Stasiak's Blog*](https://web.archive.org/web/20240705122044/http://karols.github.io/blog/2013/11/18/creating-custom-keyboard-layouts-for-linux/) (archived; [here is the original](http://karols.github.io/blog/2013/11/18/creating-custom-keyboard-layouts-for-linux/)).

My custom keyboard layout for Dundulanyä is mostly based on the Italian one as that's the language I need to type most frequently, so I treat it as an Italian keyboard layout - in doing so I enabled it to write accented capital letters as well as, in my latest revision of the layout, gender-inclusive/gender-neutral *Əǝ* and *Ɜɜ*. The Italian-Dundulanyä layout includes a bunch of diacritic-modified letters, dead keys for many ones and IPA characters sparkled here and there, mostly accessible through AltGr or AltGr+Shift.

*The original files were taken and edited in an Arch-based distro.*

This directory contains the two files that I edit/replace when needed (copying my customization and replacing them in the actual files):
- **it** contains all Italian keyboard layouts, with as the last one my Dundulanyä layout, with comments mostly in Italian;
- **evdev.xml** contains the list of keyboard layouts, with the Italian-Dundulanyä one being the last among the Italian ones.
